  ## Description:
  This application is a PWA Text Editor that has JS syntax highlighting, can save progress between sections and can be installed onto the local machine.

  ## Installation:
  Make sure that node is installed on your machine.  Then clone the git repo so you have the files locally.  Then, in a command prompt, cd into the local file folder and run npm install to install all the packages.

  This project is also deployed to Heroku and can be accessed by clicking the link: https://pwa-jate-1234-962a00b881e6.herokuapp.com/

  ## Usage:
  To use this project online, simply follow the link above to reach the app.  By default it'll have a title entered into the text editor but you are free to delete it and enter your own text.  The text will change colors when words corresponding to reserved words in Javascript are used.  

  If you wish to install the application locally, locate the install button on the top-left corner of the page.  Click Install on the prompt that opens up, then find the application's icon on your desktop.

  If you close the editor, the text you were working on will be saved so when you open it again, it will still be there.  This works whether it is online or local.
